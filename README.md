# 36490-Research-Project

Code for the 36-490 statistics research project class at CMU.

This is a group project centered around Forgery Detection of 1649 English newsbooks. Here I have uploaded my part of the code. This code mainly performs feature selection.

This code reads in the csv files with information on different pieces of texts and chooses the features that are best at predicting Ideology for a given text. After these features are generated, we can run dimension reduction algorithms like PCA and visualize on 2D plots whether given a particular Ideology group, some texts differ in features from the main groups of texts to pick out the potential forgery candidates.
